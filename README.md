# 👋 Hi, I'm Ferhat

I enjoy creating with code, whether it’s something practical or just an experiment to test an idea. 

Many of my projects start small and grow as I refine them.

I see programming both as a craft and as a way to solve real problems.

Clean structure, scalability, and maintainability matter to me, even in hobby projects.
